TODO: b/board-control
- change move delegation from nav.next(...) to externalBoardControl.clickUCI(...)

TODO b/explore-optimize 
- cache lichess explore requests so we don't spam them when going back and forth in study
- do not make request when position doesn't change (clicking next when there is no next movep)


TODO b/drag-n-drop
- promotion piece

TODO b/scoring 
- Player gets a score based on whether they respond to computer move according to their study or engine accuracy


TODO b/user-interface
- make element sizing dynamic, chessboard, move list, description

TODO b/castle-preview
- Show the move preview arrow when user highlights a castling move in the lichess explorer

TODO b/engine-rec 
- Show top x engine moves

TODO b/line-recommend-tags
- give a tag that highlights when condition is met 
    - move is a book move 
    - high engine ranking and low % played in lichess DB 
    - opponent's response is mistake (engine gains points in our advantage), but high % played in lichess DB 

BUGS
- game does not like when you push a pawn 2 spaces and then push it again on your next move. It always thinks it is a captures move\
- eval endpoint fails when the eval is not centerpawn, but mate in x


Neglected Review !!!
- if a player creates a study where they give themselves options in a position, and create lines for each, if they never play the alternatives, the whole line is considered neglected review and will 
  be picked by the computer more often.
  - Example: Danish gambit, study is white's perspective. After black playes Bb4+, white can play Nc3 or Kf1. Kf1 is more risky, so maybe player stops reviewing the line. Thus, all
    Kf1 lines reach their max neglect and are chosen all the time by the move delegator - Bb4+ is played disproportionately
  - Solutions When white has alternative lines:
    - always mark all alternatives and all sub positions as studied.
    - Let moves be marked "ignore" so the move weight calculation does not consider those positions
    - when white plays one option, then returns to the position, suggest to review the alternatives -
  - leaning toward the option to suggest the other moves. Perhaps when player starts a study, note the start time. When a position is reached with alternatives for white and one of the options 
    has been studied since the start time, draw move previews for all options.
  - but then this leaves the issue of, well the Kf1 line is dumb so I dont want to review it. So, probably combine the idea with the option to 
    ignore lines
