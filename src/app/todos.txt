TODO: b/board-control
- change move delegation from nav.next(...) to externalBoardControl.clickUCI(...)

TODO b/explore-optimize 
- cache lichess explore requests so we don't spam them when going back and forth in study
- do not make request when position doesn't change (clicking next when there is no next movep)


TODO b/drag-n-drop
- promotion piece

TODO b/scoring 
- Player gets a score based on whether they respond to computer move according to their study or engine accuracy


TODO b/user-interface
- make element sizing dynamic, chessboard, move list, description

TODO b/castle-preview
- Show the move preview arrow when user highlights a castling move in the lichess explorer

TODO b/engine-rec 
- Show top x engine moves

TODO b/line-recommend-tags
- give a tag that highlights when condition is met 
    - move is a book move 
    - high engine ranking and low % played in lichess DB 
    - opponent's response is mistake (engine gains points in our advantage), but high % played in lichess DB 

TODO b/story-board 
- Would be super cool to have some way to do a story board which takes you position to position (not move by move) with drawings and descriptions what our ideas for our opening are 

BUGS
- game does not like when you push a pawn 2 spaces and then push it again on your next move. It always thinks it is a captures move\
- eval endpoint fails when the eval is not centerpawn, but mate in x
