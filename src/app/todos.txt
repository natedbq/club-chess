- delete move 
    - Add a piece to navigator that shows the move that was taken to get to the current position.
    - trash icon appears next to the move.
    - clicking the trash icon removes the position from the parent position
- create database 
    - studies are represented in a relational database in the back-end 
    - studies reach front end in exactly the same format as they do now 
- save button does not save the whole study, only the current node and the parent chain, only dirty nodes
