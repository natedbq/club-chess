TODO b/drag-n-drop
- promotion piece



TODO b/user-interface
- make element sizing dynamic, chessboard, move list, description

TODO b/castle-preview
- Show the move preview arrow when user highlights a castling move in the lichess explorer


TODO b/line-recommend-tags
- give a tag that highlights when condition is met 
    - move is a book move 
    - high engine ranking and low % played in lichess DB 
    - opponent's response is mistake (engine gains points in our advantage), but high % played in lichess DB 

TODO b/story-board 
- Would be super cool to have some way to do a story board which takes you position to position (not move by move) with drawings and descriptions what our ideas for our opening are 

BUGS
- game does not like when you push a pawn 2 spaces and then push it again on your next move. It always thinks it is a captures move\
- eval endpoint fails when the eval is not centerpawn, but mate in x


TODO b/position-tags 
- do not allow more than 100 tags in 1 study 
- do not allow any duplicate tags
- hmm... instead of using a path of move names to find the position, can we just use the tag dictionary to keep the position and 
  activate/deactivate the position?
